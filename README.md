# 🏠 Real Estate Website

A responsive and modern Real Estate Website built to showcase properties, allow user inquiries, and simulate a real-world property listing platform. This project is designed with clean UI, user-centric navigation, and structured content layout — ideal for learning frontend development and web design.

## 🌐 Project Overview

This web project simulates a real estate platform where users can:

- Browse listed properties
- View detailed descriptions and images
- Access agent/contact information
- Navigate smoothly across pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, Listings)

It’s a static frontend implementation perfect for demo purposes, and can later be integrated with backend systems or databases for dynamic property listings.
